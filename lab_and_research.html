        <p>The C-NARC subteam is investigating how the rate of attachment of coagulant nanoparticles
          to clay particles and the flocculator walls changes over time. Research conducted by Contact
          Chamber as well as observations by other teams suggests that the rate of increase of head
          loss over the length of the flocculator is proportional to the concentration of free coagulant
          nanoparticles in each section of the flocculator. By measuring head loss through the flocculator,
          the team hopes to observe a decrease in the rate of head loss accumulation. </p>

    <div class="LR_team_container" id="LR_team_container2">
      <div class="LR_txt">
        <p> Sedimentation is a critical process for water treatment plants.
          It is the process by which coagulated minerals, dirt, clay, and other particles
          are removed from the water via gravitational settling. In a sedimentation tank,
          water flows upward as flocs settle downward. The particles settle into a "floc blanket" -
          a fluidized bed of suspended solids colliding in a bottom zone of the sedimentation tank.
          The particles are initially light and small, but as coagulant dosage persists and particles
          continue to collide, the particles clump together into heavier floc that will settle into
          the basin of the recirculator. This process permits clearer water to continue up the plate settler,
          resulting in a lower effluent NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit, a measure of clarity).
          Past High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) teams have hypothesized that floc blankets
          thin as experiments progress due to coagulant sticking to the walls of the flocculator,
          reducing the overall coagulant dosage.<p>
            <p> For this semester, the team will be focusing on the redesigning of the input
              of water into the high rate sedimentation tanks. This will include the 3D drawing
              and printing of the inserts. </p>

        <p> Fluoride contamination of groundwater is a major, well-known health concern, that

          The World Health Organization suggests the Nalgonda method, but this technique has
          several major flaws including a treatment efficiency that is limited to only 70 percent,
          and a large dose of aluminum sulfate, which causes sludge disposal problems. Instead, we
          use Polyaluminum Chloride (PACl) as a coagulant to which the fluoride can both adsorb to
          and coprecipitate with. The goals of the Fluoride Team is to design and create the optimal
          system for adsorbing and coprecipitating out fluoride from groundwater.
